## Data structures.
***

#### Structured data is easy to search and organize. Data is entered following a rigid structure, like a spreadsheet where there are set columns. Each column takes values of a certain type, like text, data, or decimal. It makes it easy to form relations, hence it's organized in what is called a relational database. About 20% of the data is structured. SQL, which stands for Structured Query Language, is used to query such data.

#### `Semi-structured`data resembles structured data, but allows more freedom. It's therefore relatively easy to organize, and pretty structured, but allows more flexibility. It also has different types and can be grouped to form relations, although this is not as straightforwards as with structured data - you have to pay for that flexibility at some point. Semi-structured data is stored in`NoSQL databases`(as opposed to SQL) and usually leverages the `JSON`, `XML` or `YAML` file formats.

#### `Unstructured data` is data that does not follow a model and can't be contained in a rows and columns format. This makes it difficult to search and organize. It's usually `text`, `sound`, `pictures` or `videos`. It's usually stored in `data lakes`, although it can also appear in data warehouses or databases.

#### Most of the data around us is unstructured. Unstructured data can be extremely valuable, but because it's hard to search and organize, this value could not be extracted until recently, with the advent of machine learning and artificial intelligence.

### `SQL` language is the industry standard to create, update, maintain and query databases.

## Columns.

#### Which column allows these two tables to form a relational database?

#### The `genre_id` column allows these two tables to form a relational database.


## Data warehouses and data lakes.
***
#### While the `data lake` stores all the data, the `data warehouse` stores specific data for a specific use.

#### A data lake can store any kind of data, whether it's structured, semi-structured or unstructured. This means that it does not enforce any model on the way to store the data. This makes it cost-effective. Data warehouses enforce a structured format, which makes them more costly to manipulate. 

#### The data warehouse, on the other hand, is optimized for analytics to drive business decisions. Because no model is enforced in data lakes and any structure can be stored, it is necessary to keep a data catalog up to date. 

#### Data lakes are used by data scientists for real-time analytics on big data, while data warehouses are used by analysts for ad-hoc, read-only queries like aggregation and summarization.


## Data catalog for data lakes.
***
#### A data catalog is a source of truth that compensates for the lack of structure in a data lake. Among other things, it keeps track of where the data comes from, how it is used, who is responsible for maintaining it, and how often it gets updated. 

#### It's good practice in terms of data governance (managing the availability, usability, integrity and security of the data), and guarantees the reproducibility of the processes in case anything unexpected happens. 


## Database vs. data warehouse.
***
#### Database is a very general term that can be loosely defined as organized data stored and accessed on a computer. It's a general term and a data warehouse is a type of database.
