## Getting started with csvkit.
`csvkit` is a suite of command-line tools for data processing on the command line.
It offers data processing and cleaning capabilities on CSV files that rival Python, R and SQL.

`in2csv` is used to convert files to CSV.
***
```bash
in2csv SpotifyData.xlsx > SpotifyData.csv
```
converts the first sheet of the xlsx file to csv format.

Use `--names` or `-n` option to print all sheet names.
***
```bash
in2csv -n SpotifyData.xlsx
```

Specify the sheet to be converted to csv format.
***
```bash
in2csv SpotifyData.xlsx --sheet "Worksheet1_Popularity" > Spotify_Popularity.csv
```

`csvlook` is used for data preview on the command line.
***

```bash
csvlook Spotify_Popularity.csv
```

`csvstat` prints a descriptive summary statistics for each column of a csv file.
***

```bash
csvstat Spotify_Popularity.csv
```

## Filtering data using csvkit.
We can create a subset of the original data file by:
1. Filtering data by column with `csvcut`
2. Filtering data by row with `csvgrep`

`csvcut` filters and truncates CSV files by **column_name** or **column_position**
***

```bash
csvcut -c 'track_id' SpotifyMusicAttributes.csv #return first column by name.
csvcut -c 1 SpotifyMusicAttributes.csv #return first column by position.

csvcut -c 2,3 SpotifyMusicAttributes.csv #return second and third column by position.
```
`csvgrep` is used to filter data by row value.

Its flags are:
1. `-m`: followed by the exact row value to filter.
2. `-r`: followed by a regex pattern.
3. `-f`: followed by the path to a file.

Find in `Spotify_Popularity.csv` where `track_id` = `5RCPsfzm'
***

```bash
csvgrep -c 'track_id' -m 5RCPsfzm Spotify_Popularity.csv
```
