## What are databases?
***
#### a database is "a usually large collection of data organized especially for rapid search and retrieval." There are few pieces of vital information in this definition. First, the database holds data. Second, databases organize data.

#### Lastly, databases help us quickly retrieve or search for data. The database management system or DBMS is usually in charge of this.

## Databases vs storage systems.
***
#### The main difference between databases and simple storage systems like file systems is the level of organization and the fact that the database management systems abstract away a lot of complicated data operations like search, replication and much more. File systems host less such functionality.


## SQL and NoSQL.
***
#### Another distinction we can make is the one between SQL and NoSQL. Generally speaking, in SQL databases, tables form the data. The database schema defines relations between these tables. We call SQL databases relational. For example, we could create one table for customers and another for orders. 


## Database schema.
***
#### The database schema defines the relationships and properties. Typical SQL databases are `MySQL` and `PostgreSQL`. On the other hand, NoSQL databases are called `non-relational`. NoSQL is often associated with unstructured, schemaless data. 

#### That's a misconception, as there are several types of NoSQL databases and they are not all unstructured. Two highly used NoSQL database types are key-value stores like `Redis` or `document databases` like `MongoDB`.

#### In `key-value stores`, the values are simple. Typical use cases are `caching` or `distributed configuration`. Values in a document database are `structured` or `semi-structured` objects, for example, a JSON object.

#### A schema describes the structure and relations of a database.

```python
data = pd.read_sql("""
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM "Customer"
ORDER BY last_name, first_name
""", db_engine)

# Show the first 3 rows of the DataFrame
print(data.head(3))

# Show the info of the DataFrame
print(data.info())
